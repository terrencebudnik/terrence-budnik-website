//           I spent many years looking for my passion. My search allowed me to have amazing experiences in Los Angeles and Chicago. After some serious thought, I decided to take an online Python course. Something clicked and that started my interest in programming. I enjoy working on projects and utilizing my past in the performing arts to bring my own creative style. I am continuing my coding education through online courses while looking for an exciting opportunity in web development.
